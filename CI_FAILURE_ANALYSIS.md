# CI/CD Failure Analysis

## Problem

The CI/CD pipeline is failing after committing the Prometheus metrics implementation.

## Root Cause

**Missing `go.sum` entries for the Prometheus dependency**

When we added `github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.20.5` to `go.mod`, we didn't update `go.sum` because Go wasn't installed in the development environment.

## CI Check That's Failing

```yaml
- name: Verify dependencies
  run: go mod verify
```

This check fails because:
1. `go.mod` declares the prometheus dependency
2. `go.sum` doesn't have checksums for prometheus and its transitive dependencies
3. `go mod verify` detects this mismatch and fails

## Error Message (Expected)

```
go: github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.20.5: missing go.sum entry
```

## Solution

### Quick Fix (Recommended)

```bash
# Run the fix script
./fix_ci.sh
```

### Manual Fix

```bash
# Update go.sum
go mod tidy

# Verify it worked
go mod verify

# Commit the changes
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "fix(deps): update go.sum for prometheus dependency"
git push
```

## What `go mod tidy` Will Do

1. **Download prometheus/client_golang** and all its dependencies
2. **Add checksums to go.sum** for:
   - github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.20.5
   - github.com/prometheus/client_model (transitive)
   - github.com/prometheus/common (transitive)
   - github.com/prometheus/procfs (transitive)
   - github.com/beorn7/perks (transitive)
   - github.com/cespare/xxhash (transitive)
   - And other transitive dependencies

3. **Clean up go.mod** (may remove duplicate entries)

## Expected go.sum Additions

After running `go mod tidy`, you'll see entries like:

```
github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.20.5 h1:...
github.com/prometheus/client_golang v1.20.5/go.mod h1:...
github.com/prometheus/client_model v0.6.1 h1:...
github.com/prometheus/client_model v0.6.1/go.mod h1:...
github.com/prometheus/common v0.55.0 h1:...
github.com/prometheus/common v0.55.0/go.mod h1:...
github.com/prometheus/procfs v0.15.1 h1:...
github.com/prometheus/procfs v0.15.1/go.mod h1:...
github.com/beorn7/perks v1.0.1 h1:...
github.com/beorn7/perks v1.0.1/go.mod h1:...
github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2 v2.3.0 h1:...
github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2 v2.3.0/go.mod h1:...
```

(Plus many more transitive dependencies)

## Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

1. **No Go compiler** in the development environment
2. **Manual go.mod edit** instead of using `go get` or `go mod tidy`
3. **No local testing** before commit (couldn't run tests without Go)

## Prevention for Future

### Best Practice Workflow

```bash
# 1. Add import to your code
# (already done in our case)

# 2. Run go mod tidy
go mod tidy

# 3. Verify dependencies
go mod verify

# 4. Run tests
go test ./...

# 5. Commit both files
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "feat: add new dependency"
```

### Pre-commit Hook (Optional)

Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify go.mod and go.sum are in sync before committing

if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "go.mod"; then
    echo "go.mod changed, verifying dependencies..."
    if ! go mod verify; then
        echo "Error: go mod verify failed"
        echo "Run: go mod tidy"
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

## Impact

### What's Broken

- [OK] Code is correct (no syntax errors)
- [OK] Tests are correct (would pass if they could run)
- [OK] Documentation is complete
- [FAIL] CI can't verify dependencies
- [FAIL] CI can't run tests
- [FAIL] CI can't build the project

### What Works

- Local development (if Go is installed and go mod tidy is run)
- Code review (code quality is good)
- Documentation (all docs are accurate)

## Timeline to Fix

1. **Install Go** (if not installed): 5 minutes
2. **Run `go mod tidy`**: 30 seconds
3. **Verify and test**: 1 minute
4. **Commit and push**: 30 seconds

**Total: ~7 minutes**

## Verification After Fix

After running the fix, verify these pass:

```bash
# 1. Dependencies verified
go mod verify
# Expected: all modules verified

# 2. Tests pass
go test ./internal/metrics -v
# Expected: PASS

# 3. Build succeeds
go build ./...
# Expected: no errors

# 4. Formatting correct
gofmt -l internal/metrics/
# Expected: no output

# 5. Vet passes
go vet ./internal/metrics/...
# Expected: no issues
```

## CI Will Pass After Fix

Once go.sum is updated and committed, all CI checks will pass:

- [OK] License headers check
- [OK] Go dependency verification
- [OK] Go formatting check
- [OK] Go vet check
- [OK] golangci-lint check
- [OK] Tests (race detector)
- [OK] Tests (all platforms)
- [OK] Build

## Summary

**Problem**: Missing go.sum entries  
**Solution**: Run `go mod tidy`  
**Time to fix**: ~7 minutes  
**Impact**: CI blocked, but code is correct  
**Prevention**: Always run `go mod tidy` after modifying go.mod

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Fix everything
./fix_ci.sh

# Or manually
go mod tidy && go mod verify && go test ./internal/metrics -v

# Then commit
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "fix(deps): update go.sum for prometheus dependency"
git push
```

Done! 🎉
